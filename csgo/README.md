# OBSOLETE

This is my personal CS:GO configuration

## Installation

Move the cfg files to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\/_YOUR STEAM ID_\730\local\cfg

### How do I find my SteamID

Open Steam and navigate to your profile's Inventory
Click the blue "Trade Offers" button in the upper right-hand corner
Scroll down to "Third-Party Sites" by "Who can send me Trade Offers"
Youâ€™ll see a URL here. The number between "?partner=" and "#&token" is your SteamID.
Write down the Steam ID and head back to your "userdata" folder.

This one makes the server that ur in bhopable easy
